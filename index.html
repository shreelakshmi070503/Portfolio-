Rhythm features personalized recommendations and smart discovery to help users find music that matches their mood and taste. A clean navigation structure ensures smooth browsing across genres, artists, and albums. The design focuses on clarity, minimal visuals, and effortless interaction to keep the music at the center. Through wireframing, prototyping, and user testing, the interface was refined for better usability and flow.

                    <p class="project-desc">
                     The Hospital Management UI was designed to help hospitals handle their daily operations in a faster and more organized way. The system supports important tasks like booking patient appointments, checking doctor availability, managing medical records, and handling emergency cases. The main goal was to create a clean and easy-to-use interface that helps hospital staff work without confusion or delays. The system has two main user roles: Doctor Side and Patient Side. On the Doctor Side, doctors can view their appointment schedules, check patient details, update treatment information, and manage test reports. They also receive alerts for emergency cases so they can respond quickly. On the Patient Side, users can book appointments, see their upcoming visits, view doctor profiles, and access their medical records and test results in a simple and secure way. While designing the interface, I focused on making the layout clear and readable by using proper spacing, clean typography, and helpful icons. The dashboard was created to give each user a quick overview of all important information on a single screen. I tested the design to make sure users could easily find important features like emergency help and appointment requests.

My approach blends creativity with usability, guided by principles like accessibility, consistency, and user-centered thinking.

I also developed an AI agent to automate content creation and posting for digital platforms, and I'm currently exploring automation tools like n8n and Make to streamline design workflows. I'm proficient in Figma and Canva, a beginner in Photoshop, and currently learning Sketch to expand my design toolkit.

I also became skilled at designing, using Figma to make professional digital graphics and Photoshop to create eye-catching posters. Most importantly, I learned how to use tools like n8n and Make to set up automation that can automatically create those posters, which saved the team a lot of time. In short, I gained a great mix of creative design, strategic marketing, and technical automation skills.
